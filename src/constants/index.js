    title: "Energy Transition and role of renewables in developing nations",
    main_desc:
      "World is currently facing a dual challenge - providing access to energy to all while reducing emissions to keep the planet away from tipping point and decelerate global warming. While developing nations have not contributed at a large scale to global warming in the past, most of them dispropotionally face the effects of global warming today in the form of rising temperatures, tropical zones converting to arid areas and in few cases resulting in mass migration and displacement of people. On the flip side, energy is crucial to uplift people from poverty and for developing nations to continue their development. Hence, they cannot reduce energy consumption at a time of economy boom and none should be forced to choose between economic prospertiy and future of the planet. Hence, energy transition is pivotal in our dually challenged world.",

      "The Evolution of Carbon Credits: From Conception to the Net Zero Horizon",
    main_desc: "The concept of carbon credits has emerged as a pioneering solution in the global fight against climate change, providing a mechanism to incentivize emission reductions and foster sustainable practices. Originating from international agreements like the Kyoto Protocol, the journey of carbon credits has seen significant progress.The inception of carbon credits can be traced back to the late 20th century with the establishment of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997. This landmark international treaty marked the first serious attempt to address the growing concern of greenhouse gas emissions. A key feature of the Kyoto Protocol was the introduction of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). The CDM aimed to facilitate emission reductions in a cost-effective manner by allowing developed countries to invest in emission reduction projects in developing nations. In return, these developed nations would receive Certified Emission Reductions (CERs), commonly known as carbon credits. This mechanism not only stimulated global cooperation but also acknowledged the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.",
    sec_dec: 'The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, emphasized the role of market-based approaches in achieving emission reduction goals. Article 6 of the Paris Agreement provided a framework for countries to engage in emissions trading and other market mechanisms, ensuring a continued role for carbon credits in the evolving climate landscape. One can argue this was also a turning point and created Voluntary carbon markets. Companies and individuals, recognizing the urgency of climate action, are voluntarily offsetting their carbon footprints by purchasing carbon credits. This trend indicates a growing awareness of the need for collective responsibility in addressing climate change and achieving net-zero targets. Given that most standards in voluntary market as well require additionality tests to be performed, with more digital advancements its becoming easier to certify businesses for carbon credits generation and trading.\n As the world collectively aims for net-zero emissions, carbon credits have become an indispensable tool in the journey. Companies and nations can utilize carbon credits to offset their residual emissions, allowing for a balanced approach to achieving net-zero targets. In addition, with introduction of carbon tax and an informal carbon budget, there is an ever increasing demand for carbon credits while simultaneously monetarily supporting projects to contribute to a greener world.'
